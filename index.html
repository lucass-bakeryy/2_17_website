<p>Coraline Jones is the main character from the movie <i>Coraline</i>. Her story is chilling.</p>
<p>Carolines story, though, could have been all in her head and never happened at all.</p>
<h3>Some noticable events:</h3>
<ul>
<li>While exploring her new house, Coraline found a hidden small door and asked her mother to open it. The door was opened but it had a stack of bricks behind the door.</li>
<li>At one night, Coraline heard mice squeaking from under her bed. When she tried to chase them, they lead Coraline to the small door and much to her surprise, it finally reveals a beautiful passage. She was initially weirded out by the button eyes but everything there was much better than the real world. Her other parents played and cook good food for her.</li>
<li>At the third night in the "other world", Coraline's other parents offered to sew in button eyes if she wanted to stay in the other world forever, Coraline freaked out and left the dinner table.</li>
<li>After managing to get away from the evil other mother Coraline went home to find that her parents were gone. The black stray cat showed Coraline that her parents were actually kidnapped by the other mother.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Famous Quote:</h3>
  <blockquote><i>"I don't want whatever I want</i>. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted just like that, and it didn't mean anything? What then?"</blockquote>
